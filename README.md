## Description
Our research paper explores various coordination mechanisms in swarm robotics, examining bio-inspired algorithms and discussing their applicability in real-world scenarios. It highlights the potential of hybrid coordination mechanisms for superior robustness, flexibility, and scalability in large-scale systems. A simulation is created using NetLogo to illustrate distributed decision-making, cellular communication mimicry and exploration with Q-learning.
